# eLDAPperDan or ldapper.pl

 ldapper is an Active Directory and LDAP interrogation tool
 I wrote this to aid in getting useful information formatted cleanly
 during penetration tests without having to switch to a windows box

# Necessary libraries:
apt-get install libnet-ldap-perl

# Example Usage:
```
user@linux:/# ./ldapper.pl
 -= el Dapper Dan Usage =-
-s Server (Target LDAP Server)
-u User (user must be user@domain or old style DOMAIN\User)
-d domain (used to create Base DN for ldap, eg site.company.com)

 -= Target Information =-
-R (Run all Queries)
   (currently: Computers, Groups, Users, Trusts, Sites)
-C (list all computers in domain)
-G (list all groups in domain and members of those groups)
-S (list all Servers in domain)
-U (list all Users in domain)
-N (list all Subnets in domain)
-T (list all Trusts in domain)
-O (list of all Organizational Units - detailed)
-g <group> (list all members of target group, case sensitive)
-M <user> (list all groups <user> is a member of)
-A <user> (list all attributes for <user> *NOTE* that this strips binary data)

# eLDAPperDan or ldapper.pl

 ldapper is an Active Directory and LDAP interrogation tool
 I wrote this to aid in getting useful information formatted cleanly
 during penetration tests without having to switch to a windows box

# Necessary libraries:
apt-get install libnet-ldap-perl

# Example Usage:
```
 -= el Dapper Dan Usage =-
-s Server (Target LDAP Server)
-u User (user must be user@domain or old style DOMAIN\User)
-d domain (used to create Base DN for ldap, eg site.company.com)

   (currently: Computers, Groups, Users, Trusts, Sites)
